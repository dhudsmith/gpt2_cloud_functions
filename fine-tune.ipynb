      " been the same number of murders in Chicago in the 1990s, in fact, the 1990s were the years when the greatest moments in the American life were the great police shootings of African- African Americans, the shootings that put Mr. and Mrs. Browning between police and homescreeners. And those were the years when African- American police officers worked really hard, and they believed us, and they brought us justice. But because we have different ideas about what we're trying to achieve, and we believe we can unite us if we go together at home and if we don't have divisive campaigns from the top down. Chicago's changed little in the last year and a half, but it's been good. The people of Chicago know what they're dealing with and they want their police to do the right thing, but they also know there's a criminal justice system in Chicago that does stop-and-frisk very, very strongly. That's why I'm running for mayor of Chicago and I want to work to make sure that kids learn, why they thrive in Chicago, and also to make sure that neighborhoods are rebuilt after the criminal justice system is reformulated and that criminal justice professionals are privy to all the facts about police use, about how they're used, and about how to prevent police violence. We have two minutes each day in this campaign. So let me this moment between us, mayor. Let me put your trust in educators. You've got to make them comfortable. Train them to be able to make decisions for themselves. Let's make up for lost hours with debt, sometimes massive amounts of debt. When I was in the Senate, I had a $20,000 check going to my name. I didn't have insurance. It was taken out by myself. Now, this is something I regret. But I have a good family. We're making progress. We're growing. We're making progress because there's an education system that works, but it's not working. Because so many kids are going to schools less than state-mandated public schools. So we have to bring back the work force. Worked for me when I was secretary of state. And we're just beginning to see results. In the education sector, we've got a lot of good work coming back. Some of it's to be expected, but we have a lot of good work coming back.\"\n",
      "'CLINTON': \"But we've got to do everything we can to rebuild our police force, to rebuild policing like it's fixing Jonathan Grubertson's house, so that it's correcting the deficit, so that it can really come to be called racial healing. And we have to bring back the trust that police have. I have a wonderful, devoted family. And I look forward to having them see that I'm doing everything I can to keep them safe. \"\n",

      "'TRUMP': 'First of all, she was after the plane ticket, the train ticket, the taxes. She was after the money. That's the money that's missing. I'm missing about $20 billion. I don't think I'm going to make anything -- $20 billion. I am, though. I'm not going to make a lot of -- $20 billion. But I'm very, very careful. And I'm very, very careful in what I say. I don't say anything. I don't bring -- I don't buy -- I don't buy a home. It doesn't have to be this way. It can be, it can be anything. I'm not proud of it. I'm not proud of it. I have a beautiful home. It's a beautiful thing. But it has to be taken care of. \"\n",

      "'WALLACE': 'We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We want to get back to the question at stake here. Do you want a tax plan that will raise taxes and spending cuts, in order to heal the debt and to make up for lost years, while at the same time remaining on the path to being a surpluses economy and a jobs economy? Mr. Trump, you've proposed a massive tax cut and trickle-down, and then you said the debt would be met by a surcharge. So, Mr. Trump, you're proposing a massive tax cut and trickle-down, and then you said the debt would be met by a surcharge. '\n",

      "'WALLACE': \"Well, we're going to -- no, we're going to get through -- we're going to get through to -- because the debt is a big problem. And you are the one that's going to drive the economy down. And, indeed, the reason you've proposed a trillion dollars\n",

      "'TRUMP': \"Well, I should -- if that's helpful. I should mention one thing. First of all, Hillary, all right. The lawsuit she's brought is called \"Secured Borders. A Success.\" It's been successful in getting lots of different countries to give her people a permit to come into the country. You know, because it involves taking out Al Qaida leaders, and also taking out ISIS, and also taking out bin Laden. But ISIS has a lot of leaders. And, Lester, they've got four leaders. And I'm sure we've got others that we can't get within our own country. Hillary and I are going to get this problem out of the way. We are going to get it out of the way. And when she left the way, it was like a vacuum came out. It was up to the Trump administration to take it out. She doesn't think tough -- tough choices have made our country safer, and so she wants to take them out. \"\n",

They've cost us jobs. We're now making -- we're losing our jobs, we're losing our money, and we're basically out of money. We kind of The Clinton Foundation raised money, you know, for the Children's Defense Fund. And it's been a disaster. It's been awfully hard to get it off. But I can promise you, we will get it off. And we will release our donors within 48 hours. So don't do anything to help her or your family. \"\n",
